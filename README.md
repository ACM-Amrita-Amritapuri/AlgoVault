# AlgoVault üìö

### Welcome to AlgoVault ‚Äì Your Ultimate Algorithm Library!

AlgoVault is a comprehensive library that houses all famous algorithms, from sorting and searching to dynamic programming and graph algorithms. Each algorithm is provided with a detailed explanation, along with a clean, structured implementation in a proper library format. This repository is designed for anyone looking to understand, learn, and apply algorithms easily, with functions ready to call and use for any purpose.

## üîç What's in AlgoVault?

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Quicksort, Mergesort, Heapsort, Bubble Sort, etc.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Binary Search, Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), etc.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Dijkstra, A*, Prim‚Äôs Algorithm, etc.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence, etc.
- **And More**: We aim to cover all fundamental algorithms that are widely used in programming!

Each algorithm is presented in:
- **Readable Code**: With comments and explanations.
- **Library Format**: Making it easy to call functions for your own projects.
- **Clear Documentation**: Explaining how the algorithm works, time complexity, and where it‚Äôs best used.
